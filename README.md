### Skin Condition Detection AI

CNN model developed by **Team Technovators**

It has an accuracy of over **75%** with the ability to classify skin diseases based on images provided by users and provides a **detailed solution roadmap** to cure the skin condition.

---

## 🌟 Overview
This **AI-powered project** uses deep learning to classify skin conditions from medical images. Built with a **Convolutional Neural Network (CNN)**, the model learns from thousands of labeled skin images to predict diseases accurately.

---

## 📂 Dataset: HAM10000
We use the **HAM10000 dataset**, which contains over **10,000 skin images** across different categories, including:

- **Melanoma** (Skin cancer)
- **Nevus** (Moles)
- **Basal cell carcinoma (BCC)**
- **Actinic keratosis (AK)**
- **Benign keratosis (BK)**
- **Dermatofibroma (DF)**
- **Vascular lesions**

---

## 🔧 Preprocessing the Images
Before training the model, the images go through:

- **Resizing** – Standardizing image size for consistency 📏
- **Normalization** – Converting pixel values from 0–255 to 0–1 🎨
- **Data Augmentation** – Flipping, rotating, and zooming to improve model robustness 🔄

---

## 🏗️ Model Architecture (CNN)
The model follows a **CNN-based approach**, which mimics how the human brain recognizes patterns.

### 🚀 Layers of the CNN:
- **Convolution Layers** – Detects edges, textures, and color variations 🖼️
- **Pooling Layers** – Reduces image size while keeping important features 📉
- **Dense Layers** – Processes information and predicts the final skin condition 🧠

---

## 🎯 Model Training
The model is trained using **supervised learning** with:

- **Loss Function**: Categorical Crossentropy
- **Optimizer**: Adam (to adjust learning rates efficiently) ⚡
- **Evaluation Metrics**: Accuracy, Precision, Recall, and F1-Score 📊

### Example Learning Process:
👶 A child learning to identify apples: At first, they confuse apples with tomatoes 🍎🍅, but with feedback, they improve. 🧠 Similarly, our AI refines its predictions over time through **backpropagation**.

---

## 📊 Model Evaluation
To measure performance, we use:

- **Accuracy**: Overall correctness ✅
- **Confusion Matrix**: Tracks classification errors 📉
- **Precision & Recall**: Balances between false positives & false negatives ⚖️

---

## 🔍 Making Predictions
Once trained, the model can analyze **new skin images** and classify the condition. 💡

Example: Just like **Google Lens** identifies objects, this AI can **detect skin diseases**! 📸

## 💡 Future Enhancements
🔹 **Improve accuracy** with more diverse datasets 📈
🔹 **Real-time skin analysis** via smartphone cameras 📷
🔹 **AI-powered dermatology assistant** for doctors 🏥
